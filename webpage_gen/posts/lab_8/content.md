## Introduction

Finally, its time for stunts! I've constructed a robust robot and communications system so that the robot can reliably execute dynamic movements. In this lab I made the robot execute a drifting turn just before hitting a wall and do a flip and reverse its direction.

I don't make any mistakes so I don't have any bloopers. (jk i make many many mistakes I just didn't catch them on camera this time.)
